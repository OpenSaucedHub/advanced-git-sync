            ## üîÑ Dependency Synchronization

            This PR automatically syncs the dependency versions in `action.yml` with the versions in `package.json`.

            ### Changes Made:
            ${{ steps.sync.outputs.changes-summary }}

            ### What This Ensures:
            - ‚úÖ Consistent dependency versions across the action
            - ‚úÖ Runtime dependencies match development dependencies
            - ‚úÖ No version mismatches between `package.json` and `action.yml`

            ### Verification Checklist:
            - [ ] All dependency versions match between `package.json` and `action.yml`
            - [ ] Action builds successfully with `bun run build`
            - [ ] No breaking changes in updated dependencies
